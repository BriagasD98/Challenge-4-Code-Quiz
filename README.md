# Challenge-4-Code-Quiz

## Introduction
This application is a quiz on JavaScript! There are 9 questions that appear in random order each with only one correct answer.
It includes features such as a dedicated start button, live timer display, scoreboard, clickable answer buttons, hover actions and a restart button.
As the user answers questions, the scoreboard keeps track of questions answered correctly.
## My Assignment
My assignment was to create a functional quiz app based on JavaScript knowledge. This allows users to test their knowledge in the 
coding language. At the end of each game, users are able to see their current score, highest score and restart the game.
The application needed to include a timer which subtracted more time from the timer if a user answered a question wrong.
